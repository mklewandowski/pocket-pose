# Pocket Pose
Pocket Pose is a mobile application that I built when doing my 200 hour yoga teacher training to help me learn yoga asanas (aka yoga poses). It contains a study guide and various quizzes that cover 75 yoga asanas. If you've ever wanted to get more familiar with your yoga poses, this little app will help.
